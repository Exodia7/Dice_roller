# Dice-roller
 This python program allows users to make one or multiple dice rolls and add the results together.
 
 
 ## TODOs
 1. Verify that the program works well, especially the functions `parse_input()`, `print_outcomes()`, and the code inside the `if __name__ == '__main__'`
 2. the file can only sum multiple dice rolls (with the `+` operator) right now, add the `-`, `*`, `/` operators

## Usage
Navigate to the directory containing the dice_roller.py file, by using the command `cd`.

Then, you can simply use the command `python dice_roller.py` to start the program.

From then on, the program should guide you through everything.
